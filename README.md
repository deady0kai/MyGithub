# MyGithub
Why did I come to github?
Hi all. 
I am an ordinary student from Russia and I decided,
that I need to do at least something with my life.

I decided to choose python because 
I want a language that is simple, cross-platform and quite powerful,
has a convenient package manager
+
python can be turned into a binary by first turning it into ะก

I know a little c++/c and will soon write in it...
